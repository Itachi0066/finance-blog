            <h1>How Gen Z is optimising its financial plans for the future</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Being from the Gen Z today comes with a number of stereotypes and associations. As the successors to
                millennials, it is perhaps inevitable for comparisons to be made between the lifestyles, outlooks, and
                priorities of these two generational cohorts. Gen Z adults (18-25-year-olds) make up an important and
                fast-growing section of the financial customer base in India. As per the 2022 revision to the World
                Population Prospects, over 50% of India’s population is aged below 25 and over 65% below 35. According
                to the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey, Gen Z adults were found to be more financially
                sophisticated than the previous generation at their age. However, while 54% of Gen Z hold some kind of
                investment, only one in three (31%) feel confident that they can explain how the stock market works to a
                friend. It seems clear that the Gen Z today is open to well-thought-out financial advice and leveraging
                it to manage their money in a responsible and productive manner. Here are the keys to the Gen Z’s style
                of financial planning:

            <p><strong> Budgeting is key: </strong>One of the toughest processes for a young adult to get used to is
                budgeting. It sounds
                so simple at first but might be difficult to settle down and stick to it. The first step is to create a
                monthly tracker of your expenses and income so that you spend and save responsibly. Unfortunately,
                budgeting involves complexities such as investments, credit payments, loans, changes in lifestyles,
                insurance premiums, etc. which are rarely taught anywhere.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            Thankfully, broad-scope frameworks like the intuitive 50-30-20 rule can significantly reduce the stress
            of budgeting every month. In layman’s terms, this rule states that 50% of one’s monthly income should be
            kept for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings. The rule of thumb is to never compromise on your
            savings and ‘needs’, while ‘wants’ can be played around with. Nowadays GenZs can access instant credit
            for the months that have excess expenses without digging into their savings. They also budget for the
            following month in such a way that they can repay a part of their availed credit by restricting
            expenditure from their ‘want’ reserves. 
            <br>
            <br>


            Capitalising on tech savviness- One of the most versatile financial avenues that Gen Zs have access to
            today is a varied set of fintech apps to conduct transactions. Apart from their quick utility and
            intuitive design, many such apps can allow an individual to ring in a lot of offers and deals which can
            make many of their aspirational purchases more palatable. Furthermore, such apps can also be used for
            responsible long-term finance.

            Certain short-term credit apps have in-built functionality for evaluating credit scores and providing
            zero-interest loans if the principal amount is repaid on time. Thus, by using such apps consistently,
            Gen Z adults can begin establishing themselves as financially responsible and build up a good credit
            score. Naturally, a robust credit score is sure to have benefits down the line for major purchases and
            bigger loans if needed in the future. 
            <br>
            <br>

            New-age investing: One of the greatest advantages that the Gen Z has when it comes to investing is the
            advantage of digital fintech instruments. No longer bound to calling brokers and banks, people today can
            use any number of online platforms to engage with the stock market, mutual funds, or government schemes
            like NPS directly. These NBFC platforms also offer tutorials and introductory courses to help Gen Z
            individuals get acquainted with the basics of investing. 
            <br>
            <br>

            These platforms are built to help diversify your portfolio, which is the core tenant of good investing.
            It can help in hedging one’s capital across multiple kinds of investments to improve security as well as
            long and short-term gains. Naturally, being comfortable with specialized services that handle mutual
            funds, BNPL, stocks, traditional banking, etc. significantly improves your financial prospects overall. 
            <br><br>

            Anticipating major expenses: As young adults, Gen Zers have a number of milestones ahead of them which
            are often financially strenuous in one way or another. Getting a higher education, buying their first
            bike or car, taking a road trip with friends, etc., are all events that can be made significantly easier
            on the wallet if one anticipates them and begins setting aside money early on. It is also advantageous
            to know when to use credit for aspirational purchases. For example, a smart Gen Z adult may wait for
            sales and festive season offers on credit apps when purchasing electronics like a new laptop or phone.
            Borrowing apps can significantly reduce costs for virtually no effort. 
            <br>
            <br>

            Dealing with FOMO: Gen Z as consumers are defined by two principles: convenience and self-expression.
            They are attracted to commercial options that are available at their fingertips for products that seem
            original and personalized to them. Given their relatively young age and exposure to the best of products
            both domestic and international, who can blame the Gen Z for aspiring for the best?
            <br>
            <br>

            However, being financially responsible means keeping a track of your debts while taking on new ones. It
            is important to delay gratification and plan your expenses accordingly. With credit being available so
            easily, Gen Zers often feel the ‘Fear of Missing Out’. However, it is important to be wary of
            overspending and taking on a fresh line of credit when all other debts have been taken care of. Not
            being able to pay back existing loans reflects poorly on your credit score, affecting all future credit
            purchases. 
            <br>
            <br>

            Planning long-term- Gen Z adults are in an unusual stage of contradictions when it comes to financial
            goals. They have seen their parents and grandparents get a good job with relative ease, settle down
            young, and buy a house, a car – the whole nine yards. Yet many of the Gen Z population would consider
            these purchases impossible at present due to how expensive they have become and how relatively little
            they seem to be earning.
            <br>
            <br>

            The responsible Gen Z adult can fall back on two foci for long-term financial stability. Firstly: start
            today. No one likes thinking about their retirement in their early twenties, yet by figuring out the
            kind of lifestyle and passive incomes they hope to have, such individuals can have tangible goals to
            work and save towards. Secondly: have an emergency fund. If there was one thing the Covid-19 did for the
            world, it was to show how quickly lives can change. During such times of uncertainty, when many young
            workers from the Gen Z may temporarily lose employment, it is essential to have a backup ready rather
            than dipping into funds reserved for other investments. 
            <br>
            <br>

            </div>

            While no one likes thinking about these worst-case scenarios so early in life, it is absolutely crucial
            for the Gen Z adult to establish a fallback early on in their lives to make them immune from many
            unforeseen changes that could otherwise ruin their financial goals and aspirations.
